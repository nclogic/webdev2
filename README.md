# Beginner HTML/CSS development reference site #2 #
This is the next iteration of my beginner site for learning.
I am going to try to make it more organized using what I learned from the 1st site, nclogic/github.io/webdev
I am learning much by doing!  
My plan is to create the content for a lesson and after I am satisfied with that, then incorporate styling.
I am sure there are many things I can or could have done differently. It's a learning experience. 
My goal is to create a beginner website that introduces new concepts in the order I wish I they would have been presented to me and not in the order they 'were' presented in all of the videos I wachted while stuck in 'tutorial hell' as it is commonly refered to.
If you read this and would like to offer any suggestions, I will definitly take them into consideration.
What I would really not like to see are sugggestions for this site that will make me essentially start from scratch. Any suggestions like that will be considered on my next iteration of a site, after completing this one ;)
Thanks for viewing my work.
P.S.
I apparently do not have a good handle on how this platform works. and any suggestions in that respect are gladly accepted. I started out by manually typing my code here while looking at the code I had written in my VSCode.
That seemed reallly inefficient so I started just pasting to overwrite existing code as I has changes.
This is you might see in my 'commit' messages caused me additional troubles because paths on my dev system did not match the paths in my folders here. My first issue was the inabilty to create subfolders of folders.
To aleaviate that, I changed my home enviorment paths to match here.
I have lots to do on my path to learning web development so please bear with me.
Thanks again!
